    </ul>

<h6>Steps</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Begin by washing pork spare ribs in cold running water to remove any visible impurities. Then, place pork ribs submerge in a medium pot with a liter of water.<br>
            Bring to a boil without covering the pot and allow the scum to float to the surface.<br>
            Meticulously remove the scums from the surface of the water using a slotted spoon or a spatula.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the broth clears up, turn you heat to medium setting, then it’s time toss in your onions and tomatoes to add flavor to the broth.<br>
            Cover your pot and let it simmer to fully cook your meat.<br>
            Use a fork to pierce the meat so that the flavors would also enter the meaty parts of the spare ribs.<br>
            You also do this so you can tell if it’s already set and tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can already add your vegetables. Start by adding the sitaw, kangkong stalks and talong into the pot and cook until these turn dark green.<br>
            If you decide to use labanos and okra, you can also add those at this point. This should take roughly around 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add in your siling sigang, kangkong leaves and the Knorr Sinigang sa Sampaloc Mix. Stir and let it simmer.<br>
            It should be done in about 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            All done! Transfer your Sinigang to a serving bowl.
